# github-finder-props-state

This is an application that queries the GitHub API and displays search results and information about individual users such as their username, profile picture, followers, and repositories. It is a tutorial app from Brad Traversy's UDEMY course, [Modern React Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/). 

I hadn't worked with React for a little while, so I took the opportunity to refresh my previous knowledge of elementary things like props and state in React components. It was also a good primer for learning about React Hooks, State, and Context in the refactored version of the app [here](https://github.com/sarahmattar/github-finder-hooks). 

### Technologies and APIs Used

GitHub API - querying GitHub users, user information, and repositories. 

Create-React-App - a simple setup for scaffolding a React client.
